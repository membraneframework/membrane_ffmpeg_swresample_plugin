# `Membrane.RawAudio.SampleFormat.serialize/1`), sample rate and number of channels
# for input and output data, respectively.
#
# Currently supported formats are u8, s16le, s32le, f32le, f64le and s24le (input only)

# Function that converts data according to a native handle.
#
# Expects the native handle, created with create/6 and binary data to convert.
#
# Returns converted samples.
#
# When converter is doing sample rate conversion, which requires "future" samples,
# samples will be buffered internally. In order to flush them,
# invoke `convert/2` with an empty binary.
#
# WARNING: Converter won't flush anything until it has enough samples for conversion to happen,
# so you won't be able to resample only a couple of samples. The actual threshold depends on
# conversion parameters.
